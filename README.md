## Action detection based on TCNN research paper, available at 
## https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10664.pdf
### About
The **main goal** of this work is to develop system that will be able to detect any action asked.


For the **first part** of the project, I aim for implementing a pioneering study of tube convolutional networks. To achieve this, I use Python and PyTorch framework for CNN development.


To test the model _UCF-50 Sports Action Detection (https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF_Sports_Action.php) dataset_ was used, which contains 10 types of actions.

Updates concerning part 2 will arrive soon.
